Welcome to my personal website!

This is the official GitHub Pages repository for my portfolio: [odk.github.io](https://odk.github.io).  
I'm Dominic Obeng Koranteng, a Data Science graduate from AIMS Ghana, passionate about applying machine learning to create innovative and practical solutions in education and agriculture.

## üåç About Me

I'm driven by a mission to use AI and data science to solve meaningful problems in communities across Africa. My key areas of work include:

- **Education**: Predictive modeling for student performance to enable data-driven academic interventions.
- **Agriculture**: AI-powered tools for poultry farming, including behavior analysis and early detection of **Newcastle disease**.

I enjoy building tools and systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects Highlighted on This Site

- **Student Performance Prediction**  
  Machine learning models that analyze academic records to identify patterns and forecast student outcomes.

- **Poultry Monitoring with AI**  
  Computer vision solutions for detecting posture, inactivity, and disease symptoms in chickens.

- **Newcastle Disease Early Detection**  
  A prototype system designed to recognize early signs of Newcastle disease through visual and behavioral cues.
